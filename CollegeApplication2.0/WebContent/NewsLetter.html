<h4><b>Innovative Measures to Leverage Graded Autonomy</b></h4>
<p align="justify">Unveiling a series of innovative measures to leverage the recently conferred Graded Autonomy, the University of Hyderabad is set to energize its academic programs, especially its research components.

The Finance Committee and the Executive Council recently approved these measures.

Two new cadres, University Distinguished Professors and University Research Professors, to be instituted. These positions, awarded through a rigorous process of scrutiny by external experts, are primarily geared towards facilitating the highly productive and recognized researchers in the University. These posts come with specific privileges in terms of emoluments, facilities and workload (in terms of, for example, teaching and courses they can be expected to offer). The expectations are, naturally, of continuing if not enhanced output of quality publications, patents and other outcomes. With this measure, the University hopes to not only reward its best researchers but also position itself as a top-class space for research, where the work by such Professors will be highlighted.</p>

<h4><b>Prestigious Indo-Japan Research Project to the School of Physics</b></h4>
<p align="justify">
Dr. Venkataiah Gorige, Assistant Professor, School of Physics, University of Hyderabad (UoH) has been awarded an Indo-Japan bilateral collaborative research project entitled “Interfacial multiferroic magnons: understanding of cross-correlation towards magnonic logic circuit applications”. The project has been jointly approved by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Japan. The project has been approved for the areas of Fundamental Science: Physical and Chemical Systems based on the scientific strength, technical aspects, project objectives and national priorities of both the countries.
